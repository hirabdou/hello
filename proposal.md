# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Horror Story Adventure

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

We are planning to make a horror choice-based story.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will start out a story, and allow the user to choose what path to take. We will allow three different endings. We are still determining how it will be executed, but it will include features such as jump scares and other scary features.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Deborah Oguche, tul48016@temple.edu, Sai Shi

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will accomplish on making a horror story with at least one ending.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Accomplishing on making a horror story with at least two endings.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Accomplishing on making a horror story with at least three endings.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First off, we will need a create a horror story. Then, we will need to make it branch off into different endings. Once we do that, we will create code that can take the player's choices and correctly give the right ending. We will need storymaking skills, code skills, game design skills, and others. We will do all of the steps together.
